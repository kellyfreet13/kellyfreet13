# 👋 Hi there! I'm [Your Name]

I'm currently a Software Engineer @ Docker 🐋. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is where I build, collaborate, and innovate with a focus on delivering powerful, scalable software solutions.

🚀 **Passionate Golang Developer** with 6 years of experience writing readable and reliable code. From architecting robust applications to orchestrating seamless migrations, I ensure that projects are completed efficiently and effectively. I believe that test code is just as crucial as production code, and I take full ownership from development to deployment and monitoring.

🤝 I thrive in collaborative environments and love helping my teammates succeed. Whether it's pair programming, code reviews, or sharing knowledge, I'm always eager to connect, code, and create together!

🏆 Outside of coding, I'm an avid chess player with 12 years of experience and enjoy staying active through tennis, skiing, and mountain biking.

Let's connect and build something amazing!
